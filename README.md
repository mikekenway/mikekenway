👋 Hey, I'm Ekko
UX Developer / Designer

💻 What I Do
I'm a full-stack creative working at the intersection of design, code, and storytelling. My background spans a decade of hands-on experience in:

🎨 UX/UI Design — thoughtful, user-centered interfaces that aren’t just pretty, but purposeful.
🧑‍💻 Front-End Development — currently working with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn, Tanstack Router/Query, Convex, Drizzle, && whatever else has my fancy that day (as i'm typing this, it's electron. I just made a TSRouter/Electron starter - check it out!).
🛠️ Infra & IT — the boring stuff. windows/linux admin, networking, and running my own little homelab.
🛠️ What I'm Building
