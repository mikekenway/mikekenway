# 👋 Hey, I'm Ekko
UX Developer / Designer

## 💻 What I Do
I'm a full-stack creative working at the intersection of design, code, and storytelling. My background spans a decade of hands-on experience in:

🎨 UX/UI Design\
```
Thoughtful, user-centered interfaces that aren’t just pretty, but purposeful.
```
🧑‍💻 (Mostly) Front-End Development
Currently working with:
```
- Next.js / React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Tanstack Router
- Tanstack Query
- GraphQL
- Convex
- Drizzle
- Python
```
&& whatever else has my fancy that day (as i'm typing this, it's Electron.
I just made a [TSRouter/Electron starter](https://github.com/mikekenway/electron-tanstack-starter) - check it out!)

🛠️ Infra & IT 
"The boring stuff", but I'm pretty good at it.
```
- Windows/Linux IT
- Networking & Server Management
- Running my own little homelab with wayyyyyy too many Docker containers
```
## 🛠️ What I'm Building
### [ApexFoundry.gg](https://github.com/mikekenway/apex-foundry)
```
Tools: Next.js, Tanstack Query, Convex, React Email
```
A Playground of fan-made tools for Apex Legends Players. Squad randomizer, current map rotations, and more! 

### [ek(klip)se](https://github.com/mikekenway/ekklipse)
```
Tools: Next.js, Convex, Monaco
```
A simple pastebin for dropping between friends/devices. I often switch between mac and windows, and there's no generally simple (and not-annoying) way to copy and paste between platforms - *until now*.

[Extra Life](https://github.com/mikekenway/extra-life)
```
Tools: Next.js, Convex, Tanstack Query, Monaco, Clerk
```
A custom app my friend and I made to enhance my yearly charity stream to raise money for Children's Miracle Network and Riley Children's Hospital. Visit extralife.kenway.me to learn more!

### [create-ekko-app](https://github.com/mikekenway/create-ekko-app)
```
Tools: Javascript, Bash, GitHub Actions, NPM Publishing
```
A silly side project I maintain to make it easy to spin up apps with my current favorite web stack. Try it out! Updated semi-regularly. 

### [ekkodex](https://github.com/mikekenway/ekkodex)
```
Tools: Next.js, Tanstack Query, auth0, Convex, PokeAPI
```
My newest side project. I'm learning about API's, and trying to build a beautiful, simple pokedex in the process. Come along for the ride!

### EkkoOS
```
Tools: Next.js, Clerk, Convex, Tanstack Query, Apple Weatherkit, Docker Compose
```
My personal productivity system app (and dev learning playground) - alongside a Docker network with 40+ containers. Tour available on request.
