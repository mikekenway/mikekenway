# 👋 Hey, I'm Ekko
UX Developer / Designer

## 💻 What I Do
I'm a full-stack creative working at the intersection of design, code, and storytelling. My background spans a decade of hands-on experience in:

🎨 UX/UI Design\
```
Thoughtful, user-centered interfaces that aren’t just pretty, but purposeful.
```
🧑‍💻 Front-End Development
```
Currently working with:
- Next.js / React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Tanstack Router
- Tanstack Query
- Convex
- Drizzle
```
&& whatever else has my fancy that day (as i'm typing this, it's Electron.
I just made a [TSRouter/Electron starter](https://github.com/mikekenway/electron-tanstack-starter) - check it out!)

🛠️ Infra & IT 
```
- Windows/Linux IT
- Networking & Server Management
- Running my own little homelab with wayyyyyy too many Docker containers
```
