# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing hero section component from CSS Grid to Flexbox to enable better control over mobile layout ordering while maintaining the exact same visual appearance on desktop. The refactor will provide more flexibility for responsive design and ensure the hero section displays optimally across all device sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor on desktop, I want the hero section to display with the photo taking up 1/3 of the width and the animated table taking up 2/3 of the width, so that the layout maintains proper proportions and visual hierarchy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on desktop (lg breakpoint and above) THEN the photo SHALL occupy exactly 1/3 of the row width
2. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the animated table section SHALL occupy exactly 2/3 of the row width
3. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the photo SHALL maintain a square aspect ratio at full size
4. WHEN viewing on desktop THEN the animated table SHALL be the same height as the photo

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor on mobile, I want the hero section elements to display in a specific vertical order, so that the content flows logically and maintains good user experience on smaller screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the elements SHALL display in this exact order: "Hi I'm Kenway" heading, "I'm a designer..." description, Hero Photo, CTA Buttons, Animated Table
2. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN the entire section SHALL be screen width with small padding on the outside edges
3. WHEN viewing on mobile THEN each element SHALL stack vertically in a single column

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the hero section to use Flexbox instead of CSS Grid, so that I can have better control over element ordering and responsive behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the layout THEN the system SHALL use Flexbox for the main layout structure
2. WHEN implementing the layout THEN the system SHALL NOT use CSS Grid for the primary hero section layout
3. WHEN implementing responsive behavior THEN the system SHALL use Flexbox order properties to control element positioning
4. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality including the animated feature tabs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the hero section to look and function exactly the same as before, so that the user experience remains consistent while gaining improved responsive behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the refactored component THEN all visual styling SHALL remain identical to the original
2. WHEN interacting with the animated tabs THEN all functionality SHALL work exactly as before
3. WHEN viewing on any device THEN the photo SHALL always maintain a square aspect ratio
4. WHEN viewing the CTA buttons THEN they SHALL maintain their existing styling and behavior
